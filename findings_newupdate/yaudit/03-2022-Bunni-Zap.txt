1. Add token revocation to functions granting approval Severity: Low Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: Currently only enterWithUnderlying() and enterWithVaultShares() revoke token approval after the function has finished executing. 
2. nonReentrant isn't needed Severity: Gas Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: nonReentrant is usually needed when a function is manipulating state variables that are used in other functions. In this case, the functions listed below are not manipulating state variables that are used in other functions, so the nonReentrant modifier is not needed. List of functions: zapIn in BunniLpZapIn.sol line 79 zapInNoStake in BunniLpZapIn.sol line 155 enterWithUnderlying in BunniLpZapIn.sol line 221 enterWithVaultShares in BunniLpZapIn.sol line 255 doZeroExSwap in BunniLpZapIn.sol line 309 
3. Payable functions don't receive ETH Severity: Informational Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: The following functions are marked as payable but are not used as such: doZeroExSwap in BunniLpZapIn.sol line 309 selfPermit in SelfPermit.sol line 36 selfPermitIfNecessary in SelfPermit.sol line 40 selfPermitAllowed in SelfPermit.sol line 47 selfPermitAllowedIfNecessary in SelfPermit.sol line 54 
4. Add events to functions Severity: Informational Difficulty: n/a Type: n/a Target: n/a Description: While the underlying dependencies in each function of the BunniLpZapIn contract emit events, the functions themselves do not emit events.
