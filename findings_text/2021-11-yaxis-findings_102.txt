# Handle  0x0x0x   # Vulnerability details  ## Proof of Concept `L839-L843` is as follow: ```             AlchemistVault.Data storage _activeVault = _vaults.last();             (uint256 _withdrawAmount, uint256 _decreasedValue) = _activeVault.withdraw(                 _recipient,                 _remainingAmount             ); ``` It can be replaced by following code block, since there is no reason to save it to memory. ```             (uint256 _withdrawAmount, uint256 _decreasedValue) = _vaults.last().withdraw(                 _recipient,                 _remainingAmount             ); ``` ## Tools Used Manual analysis
