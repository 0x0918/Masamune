# Report  ## Don't ignore ERC20 transfer return values  You're ignoring the return value of an ERC20 transfer twice:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-joyn/blob/main/core-contracts/contracts/CoreCollection.sol#L175  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-joyn/blob/main/core-contracts/contracts/ERC721Payable.sol#L54  Either use SafeERC20 or check the return value as you do in other places in the code base.  ## Add a max boundary for the platform fee  Fees should have a boundary of 100% (10000): https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-joyn/blob/main/royalty-vault/contracts/RoyaltyVault.sol#L68  Otherwise the contract will try to transfer more than possible which will result in reverts: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-joyn/blob/main/royalty-vault/contracts/RoyaltyVault.sol#L40  It might also be helpful the have an fixed upper boundary that doesn't allow the platform to collect more than a set amount of fees, e.g. 10%.  ## No connection between a project & collection  When creating a project with collections, there is no ID linking the collections to that specific project. Both entities exist independent of each other. There seems to be no way of associating them with each other after the creation (besides the emitted event).  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-joyn/blob/main/core-contracts/contracts/CoreFactory.sol#L70-L99
