# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Increased gas cost  ## Proof of Concept `store` is a variable used only once. A comment should suffice instead of a variable (see @audit-info): ``` File: BalanceHandler.sol 72:         mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => BalanceStorage)) storage store = LibStorage.getBalanceStorage(); //@audit-info store is used only once, below 73:         BalanceStorage storage balanceStorage = store[account][currencyId]; ``` ## Tools Used VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Do not store this data in a variable. Inline it instead: ``` BalanceStorage storage balanceStorage = LibStorage.getBalanceStorage()[account][currencyId]; ```
