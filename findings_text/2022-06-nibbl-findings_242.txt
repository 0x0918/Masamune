# check the wrong arggument   In this section the function check the amout of the `_adminFeeAmt` and its more correct to check the `_feeAdmin` amount because there is a case that the `_feeAdmin` will be 0 but the `_adminFeeAmt` will be greater than 0.  ``` if(_adminFeeAmt > 0) {             safeTransferETH(_factory, _feeAdmin); //Transfers admin fee to the factory contract         } ```   ``` fix -  if(_feeAdmin > 0) {             safeTransferETH(_factory, _feeAdmin); //Transfers admin fee to the factory contract         } ```
