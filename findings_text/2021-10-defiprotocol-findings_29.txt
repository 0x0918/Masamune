# Handle  pants   # Vulnerability details  The functions `Auction.initialize()` and `Basket.initialize()` look like this: ``` require(address(factory) == address(0)); require(!initialized); // ... factory = ...; // ... initialized = true;  ```  The second require statement is enough to make sure that these functions can only be called once. The first require statement is redundent.  ## Impact A redundent operation is executing.  ## Tool Used Manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Remove the first require statement in these functions.
