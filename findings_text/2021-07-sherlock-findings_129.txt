# Handle  0xsanson   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The value `10e17` can be confusing, since it doesn't clearly appear from where the exponent 17 comes from (people may ctrl+f or grep the code for other instances of it without results). Indeed throughout the code the expression `10**18` is used.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-sherlock/blob/main/contracts/facets/Payout.sol#L185  ## Tools Used editor  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Better ways of writing it are `1e18` or `10**18`.
