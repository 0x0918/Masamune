# Handle  paulius.eth   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Here are some useless calculations:   if(_token == VADER && _pool != VADER){  // Want to know added VADER      addedAmount = _balance - pooledVADER;      pooledVADER = pooledVADER + addedAmount;  } else if(_token == USDV) {             // Want to know added USDV      addedAmount = _balance - pooledUSDV;      pooledUSDV = pooledUSDV + addedAmount; if you do the simple maths, it is always in the first case, pooledVADER = _balance, in the second case pooledUSDV = _balance.
