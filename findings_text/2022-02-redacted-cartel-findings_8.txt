Below are the places where Gas can be saved:  1. bribeVault can be set to immutable at TokemakBribe.sol#L28  2. Instead of using _setupRole function in TokemakBribe.sol#L64 we can directly use _grantRole as done in grantTeamRole function  3. In revokeTeamRole function at TokemakBribe.sol#L98, require(hasRole(TEAM_ROLE, teamMember), "Invalid teamMember"); is not required since this is already checked in _revokeRole function  4. In setProposals function at TokemakBribe.sol#L142, store proposals.length in local variable and use local variable instead at all places in this function  5. In setProposals function at TokemakBribe.sol#L152, use ++i instead of i+=1. Change this in all loops at all contracts (also change i++ to ++i)  6. In depositBribeERC20 function at  TokemakBribe.sol#L222-L223, require(token != address(0), "Invalid token"); and require(amount > 0, "Bribe amount must be greater than 0"); are not required as they are already checked in depositBribeERC20 function of BribeVault.sol#L173-L174  7. The setRewardForwarding function at TokemakBribe.sol#L298 can be declared external  8. In revokeDepositorRole function at BribeVault.sol#L98, require(hasRole(DEPOSITOR_ROLE, depositor), "Invalid depositor"); is not required since this is already checked in _revokeRole function  9. In transferBribes function at BribeVault.sol#L256, store distributions.length in local variable and use this local variable at all places  10. In claim function at RewardDistributor.sol#L79, add a check to revert when require( _claims[i].amount!=0, "Invalid amount")
