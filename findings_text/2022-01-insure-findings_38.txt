# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact   Increased gas cost      ## Proof of Concept   Solidity version 0.8.* already implements overflow and underflow checks by default.  Using the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin (which is more gas expensive than the 0.8.* overflow checks) is therefore redundant.      Instances include:  ```   mocks\ERC20.sol:4:import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol"; mocks\ERC20.sol:30:    using SafeMath for uint256; mocks\TestPremiumModel.sol:3:import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol"; mocks\TestPremiumModel.sol:7:    using SafeMath for uint256; PremiumModels\BondingPremium.sol:10:import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol"; ```      ## Tools Used   VS Code      ## Recommended Mitigation Steps   Use the built-in checks instead of SafeMath and remove SafeMath from the dependencies
