# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `MarketRegistry.deleteMarket` iterates over all `uTokenList` elements.  ## Impact The transactions can fail if the arrays get too big and the transaction would consume more gas than the block limit. This will then result in a denial of service for the desired functionality and break core functionality.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Keep the array small or use an [EnumerableSet])(https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/structs/EnumerableSet.sol) that can delete in constant time.
