# Handle  Ruhum   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The comment for the `disableOffchainVoting()` function specifies that the feature can be reenabled in the future through a proposal. But, there seems to be no function to do that in the DAO contract.  ## Proof of Concept Function with the comment: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-fairside/blob/main/contracts/dao/FairSideDAO.sol#L619  No way to reassign the value: `grep offchain`  ## Tools Used Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Either remove the comment if the feature is not intended or add a function to reassign the `offchain` and `guardian` state variable
