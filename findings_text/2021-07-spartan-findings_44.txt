# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  `depositLPForMember()` and `bond()` invokes `harvest()` if a user has existing LP deposits or bonded assets into the DAO. This is to prevent users from depositing more assets before calling `harvest()` to earn more DAOVault incentives. However, `harvest()` reverts if reserve emissions are turned off.   Hence, deposits / bonds performed by existing users will fail should reserve emissions be disabled.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  Cache claimable rewards into a separate mapping when `depositLPForMember()` and `bond()` are called. `harvest()` will then attempt to claim these cached + pending rewards. Perhaps Synthetix's Staking Rewards contract or Sushiswap's FairLaunch contract can provide some inspiration.
