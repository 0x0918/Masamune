It can be staked (stakers receive a portion of ticket sales) and referral rewards.   considering that this token is the native token of this project, the security of the tokens and economic design is very important for this token.  In the LotteryToken.sol#L23 the role owner has authority over the mint function. Any compromise to the owner account may allow the hacker to take advantage of this authority and mint any LotteryToken to any address.  ## Proof of Concept In the LotteryToken.sol#L23 the role owner has authority over the mint function. Any compromise to the owner account may allow the hacker to take advantage of this authority and mint any LotteryToken to any address. function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external override {  if (msg.sender != owner) {  revert UnauthorizedMint();  }  _mint(account, amount);  }  Unauthorized token minting can cause the loss of users' funds and the destruction of the project.  ## Tools Used Manually  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps strongly recommend to use multi-sign to prevent a single point of failure due to the private key compromised.
