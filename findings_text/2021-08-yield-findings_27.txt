# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `TimeLock.schedule` function reverts if the same `targets` and `data` fields are used as the `txHash` will be the same. This means one cannot schedule the same transactions multiple times.  ## Impact Imagine the delay is set to 30 days, but a contractor needs to be paid every 2 weeks. One needs to wait 30 days before scheduling the second payment to them.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Also include `eta` in the hash. (Compound's Timelock does it as well.) This way the same transaction data can be used by specifying a different `eta`.
