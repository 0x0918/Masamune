# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details  # Impact  Comment is misleading, now stating the opposite of the implemented logic.  ## Proof of Concept  Comment states that tokens added are `not less than amount repurchased`, while it should be `not more`: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-yetifinance/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/YETI/sYETIToken.sol#L246   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Now: ``` // Ensure that the amount of YETI tokens effectively added is >= the amount we have repurchased. if (yetiTokenBalance < additionalYetiTokenBalance) {   additionalYetiTokenBalance = yetiTokenBalance; } ```  To be: ``` // Ensure that the amount of YETI tokens effectively added is <= the amount we have repurchased. if (yetiTokenBalance < additionalYetiTokenBalance) {   additionalYetiTokenBalance = yetiTokenBalance; } ```
