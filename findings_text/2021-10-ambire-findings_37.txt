# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `SignatureValidator.recoverAddrImpl` function does not revert on invalid signatures and returns zero instead. Thus if anyone added the zero address to their `privileges` by accident, funds can be stolen in `Identity.execute`.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Unless there's a valid reason for the `SignatureMode.NoSig` mode, consider reverting if `ecrecover` returns the zero address indicating an invalid signature.
