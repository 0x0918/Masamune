# Codebase Impressions & Summary  Overall, code quality for the TWABDelegator contracts is very high. Functions were well commented and ordered in visibility level, and the documentation provided made it easy to understand the intended functionality.  The test suite could be easily run. Almost 100% test coverage is achieved, where only the `Delegation` contract lacked branch coverage for a couple of edge cases.  The findings I made only involved incorrect comments for a function and couple of events.  # Low Severity Findings  ## L01: Incorrect comment on `transferDelegationTo()`  ### Line References  [https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-twab-delegator/blob/master/contracts/TWABDelegator.sol#L370-L371](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-twab-delegator/blob/master/contracts/TWABDelegator.sol#L370-L371)  ### Description  The comments say that the withdrawn tickets are transferred to the caller / delegator wallet, but are actually transferred to the `_to` address.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  ```jsx * @notice Withdraw an `_amount` of tickets from a delegation. The delegator is assumed to be the caller. * @dev Tickets are sent directly to the passed `_to` address ```  ## L02: Incorrect comment on `TransferredDelegation` event  ### Line References  [https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-twab-delegator/blob/master/contracts/TWABDelegator.sol#L125-L136](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-twab-delegator/blob/master/contracts/TWABDelegator.sol#L125-L136)  ### Description  In relation to L01, the `TransferredDelegation` event  - is incorrectly commented that the withdrawn tickets are transferred to the caller / delegator wallet - lacks a description about the `to` indexed parameter.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  ```jsx /**  * @notice Emitted when a delegator withdraws an amount of tickets from a delegation to a specified wallet.  * @param delegator Address of the delegator  * @param slot  Slot of the delegation  * @param amount Amount of tickets withdrawn  * @param to Recipient address of withdrawn tickets  */   event TransferredDelegation(     address indexed delegator,     uint256 indexed slot,     uint256 amount,     address indexed to   ); ```  ## L03: Incorrect comment on `DelegationFundedFromStake` event  ### Line References  [https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-twab-delegator/blob/master/contracts/TWABDelegator.sol#L102](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-twab-delegator/blob/master/contracts/TWABDelegator.sol#L102)  ### Description  The `DelegationFundedFromStake()` allows a representative or delegator himself to fund a delegation contract using the delegator’s stake. The `user` in the `DelegationFundedFromStake` event refers to `msg.sender`. Since the funds are coming solely from the delegator, its description isn’t entirely correct.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  `@param user Address of the user who pulled funds from the delegator to the delegation`  # Non-Critical Findings  ## NC01: Extra whitespace in slot description of `WithdrewDelegationToStake()` event  ### Line References  [https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-twab-delegator/blob/master/contracts/TWABDelegator.sol#L114](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-twab-delegator/blob/master/contracts/TWABDelegator.sol#L114)  ### Description  There is an additional spacing between `slot` and `Slot`.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  Remove the spacing to become: `* @param slot Slot of the delegation`  # Suggestions  ## S01: TWABDelegator: Consider renaming `_delegateCall()` to `_setDelegateeCall()`  ### Line References  [https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-twab-delegator/blob/master/contracts/TWABDelegator.sol#L519](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-twab-delegator/blob/master/contracts/TWABDelegator.sol#L519)  ### Description  `_delegateCall()` could easily be confused for the inbuilt `delegatecall()` method. I recommend renaming it to something more distinguishable like `_setDelegateeCall()`.
