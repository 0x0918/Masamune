# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact function safeTransferFrom is almost identical to function transferFrom. It would be better to reduce code duplication by re-using the code.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps    function safeTransferFrom(         address from,         address to,         uint256 tokenId,         bytes memory _data     ) public override {         transferFrom(from, to, tokenId);         _data;     }
