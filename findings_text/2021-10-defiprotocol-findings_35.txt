# Handle  pants   # Vulnerability details  The functions `Factory.getProposalWeights()` and `Factory.createBasket()` read values from storage multiple times instead of caching them in local variables: - `Factory.getProposalWeights()` reads `_proposals[id]` twice. - `Factory.createBasket()` reads `_proposals[idNumber]` twice.  ## Impact Storage reads are much more expensive than reading local variables.  ## Tool Used Manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Read these values from storage once, cache them in local variables and then read them again from the local variables.
