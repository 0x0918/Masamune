# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `Gov.tokenInit` skips the underlying token check if the `_token` is SHERX:  ```solidity if (address(_token) != address(this)) {   require(_lock.underlying() == _token, 'UNDERLYING'); } ```  ## Impact This check should still be performed even for `_token == address(this) // SHERX`, otherwise, the lock can have a different underlying and potentially pay out wrong tokens.  ## Recommendation Verify the underlying of all locks.
