# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `ThreePieceWiseLinearPriceCurve.getFee` comment states that the total + the input must be less than the cap:  > If dollarCap == 0, then it is not capped. Otherwise, **then the total + the total input** must be less than the cap.  The code only checks if the input is less than the cap:  ```solidity // @param _collateralVCInput is how much collateral is being input by the user into the system if (dollarCap != 0) {     require(_collateralVCInput <= dollarCap, "Collateral input exceeds cap"); } ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Clarify the desired behavior and reconcile the code with the comments.
