# Handle  itsmeSTYJ   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  If tokensNeeded is 0, it is possible to remove all the funds in the basket since no tokens are required to pass the balanceOf checks. The chances of this happening is very unlikely however it is better to be safe than sorry.   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add a require statement to check that the numerator (`basketAsERC20.totalSupply() * pendingWeights[i] * newRatio`) is greater than or eq to the denominator (`BASE * BASE`). This will ensure that it can never round down i.e. tokensNeeded can never be 0.
