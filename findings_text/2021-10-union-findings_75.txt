# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `UToken` contract uses solidity version 0.8 which already comes with implicit overflow checks. The explicit overflow checks in `removeReserves` can be removed:  ```solidity // We checked reduceAmount <= totalReserves above, so this should never revert. // @audit this overflow check already happened implicitly require(totalReservesNew <= totalReserves, "reduce reserves unexpected underflow"); ```
