 Title: Does not validate the input fee parameter Severity: Low Risk   Some fee parameters of functions are not checked for invalid values. Validate the parameters:                           RoyaltyVaultFactory.setPlatformFeeRecipient (_platformFeeRecipient)         RoyaltyVaultFactory.setPlatformFee (_platformFee)         SplitFactory.setPlatformFeeRecipient (_platformFeeRecipient)         CoreCollection.initialize (_mintFee)         RoyaltyVault.setPlatformFeeRecipient (_platformFeeRecipient)         RoyaltyVault.setPlatformFee (_platformFee)         SplitFactory.setPlatformFee (_platformFee)    Title: Never used parameters Severity: Low Risk  Those are functions and parameters pairs that the function doesn't use the parameter. In case those functions are external/public this is even worst since the user is required to put value that never used and can misslead him and waste its time.           Splitter.sol: function attemptETHTransfer parameter value isn't used. (attemptETHTransfer is private)    Title: Not verified claimer Severity: Low Risk   If a functions gets as input a claimer param, then it should make sure the claimer address is not address(0). Otherwise it will cause to loss of the funds or access.           ERC721Claimable.sol._claim claimer    Title: Missing commenting Severity: Low Risk           The following functions are missing commenting as describe below:                  MultiSigWallet.sol, external_call (private), parameters destination, value, dataLength, data not commented         SplitProxy.sol, splitter (public), @return is missing         MultiSigWallet.sol, external_call (private), @return is missing    Title: Two Steps Verification before Transferring Ownership Severity: Low Risk  The following contracts have a function that allows them an admin to change it to a different address. If the admin accidentally uses an invalid address for which they do not have the private key, then the system gets locked. It is important to have two steps admin change where the first is announcing a pending new admin and the new address should then claim its ownership.  A similar issue was reported in a previous contest and was assigned a severity of medium: [code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings#105](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/105)           ICoreCollection.sol    Title: Not verified owner Severity: Low Risk           owner param should be validated to make sure the owner address is not address(0).         Otherwise if not given the right input all only owner accessible functions will be unaccessible.                           MultiSigWallet.sol.replaceOwner owner         MultiSigWallet.sol.removeOwner owner         MultiSigWallet.sol.addOwner owner         MultiSigWallet.sol.replaceOwner newOwner    Title: Duplicates in array Severity: Low Risk  You allow in some arrays to have duplicates. Sometimes you assumes there are no duplicates in the array.              MultiSigWallet.addOwner pushed (owner)    Title: Solidity compiler versions mismatch Severity: Low Risk   The project is compiled with different versions of solidity, which is not recommended because it can lead to undefined behaviors.                      Title: Not verified input Severity: Low Risk       external / public functions parameters should be validated to make sure the address is not 0.     Otherwise if not given the right input it can mistakenly lead to loss of user funds.                       MockCollection.sol.setRoyaltyVault _royaltyVault         Splitter.sol.setClaimed who         CoreCollection.sol.setRoyaltyVault _royaltyVault         RoyaltyVault.sol.setPlatformFeeRecipient _platformFeeRecipient    Title: Require with empty message Severity: Low Risk  The following requires are with empty messages.  This is very important to add a message for any require. Such that the user has enough  information to know the reason of failure:           Solidity file: MultiSigWallet.sol, In line 99 with Empty Require message.         Solidity file: CoreMultiSig.sol, In line 21 with Empty Require message.
