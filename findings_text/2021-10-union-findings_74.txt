# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `UToken` contract uses solidity version 0.8 which already comes with implicit overflow checks. The explicit overflow checks in `addReserves` can be removed:  ```solidity /* Revert on overflow */ // @audit this overflow check already happened implicitly require(totalReservesNew >= totalReserves, "add reserves unexpected overflow"); totalReserves = totalReservesNew; ```
