# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `ConcentratedLiquidityPool.mint/burn` functions add/remove `liquidity` when `(priceLower < currentPrice && currentPrice < priceUpper)`. Shouldn't it also be changed if `priceLower == currentPrice`?  ## Impact Pools that mint/burn liquidity at a time where the `currentPrice` is right at the lower price range do not work correctly and will lead to wrong swap amounts.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Change the inequalities to `if (priceLower <= currentPrice && currentPrice < priceUpper)`.
