# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Some of the require statements can be placed earlier to reduce gas usage on revert. As a reminder from the [Ethereum Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf), Appendix G and Appendix H: - TIMESTAMP costs 2 gas - ADDRESS costs 2 gas - MLOAD costs 3 gas  ## Proof of Concept The following can be reorder to save gas on revert:  ```         require(block.timestamp < maturity, 'E202');          require(ids.length == assetsIn.length && ids.length == collateralsOut.length, 'E205');         require(to != address(0), 'E201');         require(to != address(this), 'E204'); ``` to ```         require(block.timestamp < maturity, 'E202');         require(to != address(0), 'E201');         require(to != address(this), 'E204');         require(ids.length == assetsIn.length && ids.length == collateralsOut.length, 'E205'); ```  ## Tools Used VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Relocate the said require statements
