# Double Initialize on Diamond Init  # Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-connext/blob/4dd6149748b635f95460d4c3924c7e3fb6716967/contracts/contracts/core/connext/facets/upgrade-initializers/DiamondInit.sol#L36   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact An attacker could Double Initialize the Diamond Init contract due to unsafe checks.  ## Proof of Concept 1. Clone the Contest Repo. 2. Start Remixd and go to Remix website and connect with local host 3. Open DiamondInit contract. 4. Compile it and call the init function multiple times with different arguments and accounts.  ## Tools Used Remixd and Remix  ## Root Cause  There is no Standard Initializer modifier on init function. It seems the contract sets the `s.initalized = true` but this cannot be a valid check because I was able to call it multiple times on testing.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Use Initializer modifier on Openzepplin library.
