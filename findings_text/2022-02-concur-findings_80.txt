# Non critical  ## Lack of events  The method [ConcurRewardPool.pushReward](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/ConcurRewardPool.sol#L23) should emit an event in order to be detectable by the `_recipient`.  ## Non exploitable reentrancy  The method [ConcurRewardPool.claimRewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/ConcurRewardPool.sol#L34-L37) allow the reentrancy, it seems that it's not vulnerable but it should be protected in order to be resilient.  # Low  ## Contract management risks  The following contracts are `Ownable` and `Pausable`, so the owner could resign while the contract is paused, causing a Denial of Service. Owner resignation while paused should be avoided: - [ConvexStakingWrapper](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L14) - [StakingRewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L12)  ## contracts\ConvexStakingWrapper.sol  1. It was found some `transfer`, `approve` or `transferFrom` without checking the boolean result, ERC20 standard specify that the token can return false if this call was not made, so it's mandatory to check the result of these methods.  As following you can see the affected locations: - [ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L179](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L179) - [ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L182](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L182)  2. There are a lack of checks in the method [requestWithdraw](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L287) that allow to create a request for `_amount=0` it should be denied in order to avoid possible errors.
