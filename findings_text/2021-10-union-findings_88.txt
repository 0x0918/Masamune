# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact It is not efficient to have a struct with only 1 field as structs are meant for grouping related information together. A market struct can be replaced by directly pointing to a bool value:     //before     mapping(address => Market) public supportedMarkets;     struct Market {         bool isSupported;     }     //after    mapping(address => bool) public supportedMarkets;
