# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact There are imports that are not necessary. They will increase the size of deployment with no real benefit. Consider removing them to save some gas.  Examples of such imports are: in contract DrawBuffer imported twice: import "./interfaces/IDrawBeacon.sol";  in contract DrawCalculator: import "./libraries/DrawRingBufferLib.sol"; import "./PrizeDistributor.sol";  in contract PrizeDistributor: import "./interfaces/IDrawBeacon.sol";  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider removing imports that are not actually used in the contract.
