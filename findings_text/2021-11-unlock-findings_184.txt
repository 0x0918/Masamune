# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  It's a best practice to limit the visibility to `external` if the function is expected to be called externally only.  ```solidity=180{185}   /**    * Public function which returns the total number of unique owners (both expired    * and valid).  This may be larger than totalSupply.    */   function numberOfOwners()     public     view     returns (uint)   {     return owners.length;   } ```  `numberOfOwners()` can be changed to `external`.
