# Handle  itsmeSTYJ   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  There is no impact to the funds but to align with [best practices]([https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/checks_effects_interactions.html](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/checks_effects_interactions.html)), it is always better to update internal state before any external function calls.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  For functions `exitVaultFillingZcTokenExit()` and `exitZcTokenFillingVaultExit()`, you should do `mPlace.custodialExit(...)` to update the internal accounting before transferring the tokens out.
