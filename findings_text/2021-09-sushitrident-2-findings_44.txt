# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `TridentNFT.permit` function ignores the `recoveredAddress != 0` check if `isApprovedForAll[owner][recoveredAddress]` is true.  ## Impact If a user accidentally set the zero address as the operator, tokens can be stolen by anyone as a wrong signature yield `recoveredAddress == 0`.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Change the `require` logic to `recoveredAddress != address(0) && (recoveredAddress == owner) || isApprovedForAll[owner][recoveredAddress])`.
