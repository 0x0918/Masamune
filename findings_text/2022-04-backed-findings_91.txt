# Summary  We list 2 non-critical findings here:  * (Non) loanEndSeconds does not check valid loanId * (Non) Should use safe version of ERC721 functions  In conclusion, it's better to check the validity of the mapping’s key. And using a safe version of ERC721 functions is usually a better choice.  # (Non) loanEndSeconds does not check valid loanId ## Impact  In `NFTLoanFacilitator.sol/loanEndSeconds()`, it doesn’t check whether loanId is valid  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backed/blob/main/contracts/NFTLoanFacilitator.sol#L363  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add check for loanId # (Non) Should use safe version of ERC721 functions  ## Impact  In `NFTLoanFacilitator.sol`, it uses `IERC721Mintable(borrowTicketContract).mint` which is not a good practice.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backed/blob/main/contracts/NFTLoanFacilitator.sol#L102  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backed/blob/main/contracts/NFTLoanFacilitator.sol#L161   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Use `safeMint` instead of `mint`
