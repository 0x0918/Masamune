# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  As defined in the ERC20 Specification, the approve function returns a bool that signals the success of the call. However, in `Basket.sol#approveUnderlying()` the value returned from calls to approve is ignored.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Basket.sol#L224-L228  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  To handle calls to approve safely, consider using the safeApprove function in OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeERC20 contract for all approvals.
