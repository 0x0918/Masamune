# Handle  pants   # Vulnerability details  The function `MainToken.set_admin()` emits `SetAdmin` events when the admin hasn't changed and left as it was before that transaction.  ## Impact There is no reason to emit these `SetAdmin` events because nothing has changed in the system. Such events are only going to confuse users.  ## Tool Used Manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Emit these events only when the new admin is different than the old one.
