# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact This double division by BASE can be eliminated to improve precision and reduce gas costs:    uint256 tokensNeeded = basketAsERC20.totalSupply() * pendingWeights[i] * newRatio / BASE / BASE;  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps if you introduce a constant variable, e.g.:    uint256 private constant BASE_2X = BASE * 2;    uint256 tokensNeeded = basketAsERC20.totalSupply() * pendingWeights[i] * newRatio / BASE_2X;
