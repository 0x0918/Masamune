# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Instead of performing a zero-address check in moveRewardAddress on L146 or L152, it is more efficient to do so in newAddressProposal() as soon as the new address is proposed, instead of allowing a proposal for zero-address which goes through the whole voting process. If there is a requirement for zero-address proposals, it should be specified explicitly.  Depending on the participation in the voting process, this will save significant amount of gas for all the participants.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-04-vader/blob/3041f20c920821b89d01f652867d5207d18c8703/vader-protocol/contracts/DAO.sol#L69-L74  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-04-vader/blob/3041f20c920821b89d01f652867d5207d18c8703/vader-protocol/contracts/DAO.sol#L144-L154  ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Perform input validation of zero-address in newAddressProposal() for proposedAddress parameter.
