# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact If you want to save some gas you can get rid of _getPrizeSplitAmount and calculate the split directly in _distributePrizeSplits as this function is internal and is only called once so there is no actual need for reusability here and removing this extra call will make the execution cheaper.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider moving the logic of _getPrizeSplitAmount  directly to _distributePrizeSplits.
