# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  - `_pool` is fetched once in `claimForMember()`, but is fetched again in its sub function `decreaseWeight()`. Since `decreaseWeight()` is solely called by `claimForMember()`, the `_pool` variable can be passed as an input to `decreaseWeight()` to avoid having to retrieve its value again. - In `increaseWeight()` and `decreaseWeight()`, zeroing out `mapMemberPool_weight` is redundant as it is set to another value 2 lines later.
