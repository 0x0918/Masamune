**AaveV3YieldSource.sol**  - L136-145 - _decimals which is uint8 would be better than this together with REFERRAL_CODE uint16 , so it takes up less storage space.  - L168.171.174 - In the constructor, it is not necessary to validate if it is zero, since if an interface is set in the input parameters of the signature, it already includes the validation that it is different from zero.  - L235.236.237 - _tokenAddress() is view therefore it does not generate a gas cost, instead the creation of the variable and its use does. It would be best to call _tokenAddress() directly.  - L252.253.259 - _tokenAddress() is view therefore it does not generate a gas cost, instead the creation of the variable and its use does. It would be best to call _tokenAddress() directly.  - L260.262  -  It could be executed like this and it would save creating a variable (_assetToken.balanceOf(address(this))).sub(_beforeBalance);  - L232.239.241 - _tokenToShares() is a view function, so it can be passed as a parameter without creating a local variable, this would reduce the gas by 2000.  - L255.256.265 - _tokenToShares() is a view function, so it can be passed as a parameter without creating a local variable, this would reduce the gas by 2000.
