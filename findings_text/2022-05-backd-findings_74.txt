1. Some functions have unused return value. Most of functions have `bool` return value to indicate success or failure. But the following functions return always true or revert transaction, so the return value is meaning less. https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/main/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/KeeperGauge.sol#L57-L62  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/main/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/AmmGauge.sol#L49-L54  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/main/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/KeeperGauge.sol#L72-L90   Recommendation: Return false for special conditions, or remove return value.  2. `reportFees()` function of `KeeperGauge.sol` needs to have zero amount check. There is no zero amount check in `reportFees()` function, thus `beneficiary`â€™s `firstEpochSet` and `nextEpochToClaim` will be initialized, and this lead high gas cost in claim function.  Recommendation: Check zero amount to avoid updating data and wasting gas.
