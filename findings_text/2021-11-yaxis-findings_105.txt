# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Contract Transmuter inherits a functionality of the Context contract of OpenZeppelin: ```solidity   contract Transmuter is Context ``` https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Context.sol Context is designed to be used with Ethereum Gas Station Network (GSN), thus it encourages to use _msgSender() instead of msg.sender.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider replacing msg.sender with _msgSender() or getting rid of Context inheritance to save some gas if you don't actually need it.
