Gas fee improvement https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-nested/blob/main/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L100 there is no need to use extra variable operatorsCache to check if operator exists.   https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-nested/blob/main/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L111 In the removeOperator function, no need for this line uint256 operatorsLength = operators.length; Use operators.length directly in the loop  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-nested/blob/main/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L177 getAssetTokensLength() function is not called from the contract. If not needed it can removed or should be made external  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-nested/blob/main/contracts/NestedFactory.sol#L191 Function tokenHoldings() is not called from within the contract. If not needed it can be removed or should be made external  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-nested/blob/main/contracts/NestedAsset.sol#L52 Function originalOwner() is not called from within the contract. If not needed it can be removed or should be made external  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-nested/blob/main/contracts/OperatorResolver.sol#L16 Add empty string check for this function  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-nested/blob/main/contracts/OperatorResolver.sol#L57 If bith names.length and operatorsToImport.length == 0, this check passes. Consider adding empty check to both structures  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-nested/blob/main/contracts/FeeSplitter.sol#L204 Nested _addShare _sendFees calls _addShare But in sendFeesWithRoyalties(), _addShare is called again after _sendFees. This can lead to nested executed. Please consider refactoring this code.
