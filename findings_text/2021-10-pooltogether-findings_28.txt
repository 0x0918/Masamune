# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `PrizePool` defines `using SafeERC20 for IERC721;` which means the `SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom` function will be used in `awardExternalERC721`. However, this function is just a wrapper for `contract.transferFrom` with a return-value and success check.  Thus this call actually calls `ERC721.transferFrom` instead of `ERC721.safeTransferFrom` and does not call the important `onERC721Received` check for contracts.  ## Impact ERC721s can be awarded to contracts that don't know how to handle it and they can get stuck.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Remove the `using SafeERC20 for IERC721;` line.
