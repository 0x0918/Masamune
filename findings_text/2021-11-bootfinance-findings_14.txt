# Handle  pants   # Vulnerability details  optimizing for loops by caching memory array length, instead of calling it every time.  For example at Swap.sol at time 158 you should have  uint8 len = _pooledTokens.length and in the next line define the forloop with stop condition of  i<len  This appears in many places in the code. At some places you did cached the array length correctly.
