# Handle  broccoli   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  When an lp provider deposits an imbalance amount of token, a swap fee is applied. HybridPool uses the same `_nonOptimalMintFee` as `constantProductPool`; however, since two pools use different AMM curve, the ideal balance is not the same.  ref: [StableSwap3Pool.vy#L322-L337](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract/blob/master/contracts/pools/3pool/StableSwap3Pool.vy#L322-L337)  Stable swap Pools are designed for 1B+ TVL. Any issue related to pricing/fee is serious. I consider this is a high-risk issue  ## Proof of Concept  [StableSwap3Pool.vy#L322-L337](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract/blob/master/contracts/pools/3pool/StableSwap3Pool.vy#L322-L337)  [HybridPool.sol#L425-L441](https://github.com/sushiswap/trident/blob/9130b10efaf9c653d74dc7a65bde788ec4b354b5/contracts/pool/HybridPool.sol#L425-L441)  ## Tools Used  None  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Calculate the swapping fee based on the stable swap curve.
