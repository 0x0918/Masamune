# Handle  a_delamo   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  In the Pool.sol contract there is the following code:  ``` function _update(         uint128 baseBalance,         uint128 fyBalance,         uint112 _baseCached,         uint112 _fyTokenCached     ) private {         ....              cumulativeBalancesRatio +=                 (scaledFYTokenCached / _baseCached) *                 timeElapsed;         ....     } ```  The multiplication should be always placed at the end to avoid miscalculations like the following one:  ```   a = (b/d)*c   0 = (5/10)*2      a = (b * c)/ 2   1 = (5 * 2)/10  ```
