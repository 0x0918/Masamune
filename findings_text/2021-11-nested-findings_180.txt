# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `NestedFactory.addOperator` function pushes the `operator` even if it already exists in `operators`.  ## Impact When this duplicated operator is removed through a `removeOperator` call, only the first instance is removed. The operator can now still be called which can lead to unexpected behavior.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Check if the operator already exists before adding it.
