# Handle  CertoraInc   # Vulnerability details  ## Flan.sol (`safeTransfer()` function) The flan contract must have balance (and must have more flan then we want to transfer) in order to allow flan transfers. If it doesn't have any balance, the safeTransfer, which is the only way to transfer flan, will call `_transfer()` function with `amount = 0`. It should check `address(msg.sender)`'s balance instead of `address(this)`'s balance.  ```sol function safeTransfer(address _to, uint256 _amount) external {        uint256 flanBal = balanceOf(address(this)); // the problem is in this line        uint256 flanToTransfer = _amount > flanBal ? flanBal : _amount;        _transfer(_msgSender(), _to, flanToTransfer);    } ```
