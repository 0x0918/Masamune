# Handle  pmerkleplant   # Vulnerability details  Function `triggerForToken` in `NestedBuybacker.sol` makes a `balanceOf` call on the `_sellToken`, see [line 100](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested/blob/main/contracts/NestedBuybacker.sol#L100).  However, the result of the call is never used.  It would save gas to remove the unnecessary call and variable declaration.
