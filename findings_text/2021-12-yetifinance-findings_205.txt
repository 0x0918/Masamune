# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `sYETIToken.transferFrom` function does not emit a new `Approval` event when decreasing the allowance. Most ERC20 implementations, like OpenZeppelin's, emit this event when the `allowance` is decreased.  ## Impact Off-chain scripts and frontends will not correctly track the `allowance`s of users when listening to the `Approval` event. This can lead to failed transactions as a higher approval is assumed than it actually is.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Emit the `Approval` event also in `transferFrom` if the approval is decreased.
