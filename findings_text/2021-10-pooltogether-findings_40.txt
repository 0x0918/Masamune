# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-core/blob/055335bf9b09e3f4bbe11a788710dd04d827bf37/contracts/prize-strategy/PrizeSplit.sol#L135-L136  ```solidity PrizeSplitConfig memory split = _prizeSplits[index]; _tempTotalPercentage = _tempTotalPercentage + split.percentage; ```  Only `percentage` of the `PrizeSplitConfig` struct is accessed, however, the current implementation created a memory variable that will load `_prizeSplits[index]` and copy to memory, this is unnecessary and gas inefficient.  ### Recommendation  Change to:  ```solidity _tempTotalPercentage = _tempTotalPercentage + split.percentage; ```
