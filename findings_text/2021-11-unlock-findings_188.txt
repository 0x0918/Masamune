# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  The current design/implementation of freeTrial allows users to get full refund before the freeTrial ends. Plus, a user can transfer partial of thier time to another user using `shareKey`.  This makes it possible for the attacker to steal from the protocol by transferring freeTrial time from multiple addresses to one address and adding up to `expirationDuration` and call refund to steal from the protocol.  ### PoC  Given:  - `keyPrice` is 1 ETH; - `expirationDuration` is 360 days; - `freeTrialLength` is 31 days.  The attacker can create two wallet addresses: Alice and Bob.  1. Alice calls `purchase()`, transfer 30 days via `shareKey()` to Bob, then calls `cancelAndRefund()` to get full refund; Repeat 12 times; 2. Bob calls `cancelAndRefund()` and get 1 ETH.  ### Recommendation  Consider disabling `cancelAndRefund()` for users who transferred time to another user.
