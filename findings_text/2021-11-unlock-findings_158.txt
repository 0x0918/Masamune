# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `Unlock.setLockTemplate` function sets the default lock tempalte for new lock creations. However, it does not verify that this lock template is a valid template that was added to `_publicLockVersions` via `addLockTemplate`.  ## Impact A default template with a wrong version number can be set which is incompatible with updating locks through `upgradeLock` (requires `version == currentVersion + 1`).  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add new lock templates using `addLockTemplate` first and restrict `setLockTemplate` to only use these templates, not arbitrary code.
