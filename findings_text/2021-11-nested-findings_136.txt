# Handle  GreyArt   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  A user that mistakenly calls either `create()` or `addToken()` with WETH (or another ERC20) as the input token, but includes native ETH with the function call will have his native ETH permanently locked in the contract.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  It is best to ensure that `msg.value = 0` in `_transferInputTokens()` for the scenario mentioned above.  ```jsx } else if (address(_inputToken) == ETH) {  ... } else {  require(msg.value == 0, "NestedFactory::_transferInputTokens: ETH sent for non-ETH transfer");   _inputToken.safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _inputTokenAmount); } ```
