# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  The `uint128` output by `_updateRewardsPerToken()` isn't used by any function. Furthermore, L107 returns a wrong value.  `if (_totalSupply == 0 || block.timestamp.u32() < rewardsPeriod.start) return 0;`  It should return `rewardsPerToken_.accumulated` instead, because in the case of a new rewards schedule being set, `rewardsPeriod.start` is updated to a new timestamp. Hence, the current accumulated value of all previous reward schedules thus far should be returned.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  Since the return value isn't used anywhere, remove it.
