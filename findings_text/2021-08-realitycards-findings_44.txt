It should be removed from the diagram.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  ```jsx /* setup AccessControl                   UBER_OWNER     ┌───────────┬────┴─────┬────────────┐     │           │          │            │            OWNER      FACTORY    ORDERBOOK   TREASURY     │           │  GOVERNOR     MARKET     │  WHITELIST | ARTIST | AFFILIATE | CARD_AFFILIATE */ ```
