# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `SyntheticToken` overwrites the `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook and removes the pausing functionality of `ERC20PresetMinterPauser`. But the `ERC20PresetMinterPauser` constructor still assigns pauser roles which leads to unnecessary gas costs. Inherit from an `ERC20PresetMinterPauser`-like contract without the pausing functionality. This would also make the intention of the code more clear by showcasing that it does not implement the pauser interface functions `pause`/`unpause` (which it currently still does but they don't have any effect).
