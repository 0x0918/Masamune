GAS :  1. Title : Its cheaper using delete  Impact :  In the removeLiquidity function if the diff value is 0, its cheaper to use delete instead setting the pos, vAsset, vUSD, dToken to zero, this can save +- 3 gas  POC :  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/AMM.sol#L243-L246  Mitigation :  ```  delete __maker.pos;  delete __maker.vAsset;  delete __maker.vUSD;  delete __maker.dToken; ```  2. Title : its cheaper to save length value to a local variable  Impact : when using a loop, its cheaper to save the length value of an array to a variable, so the loop didn't have to read the storage length in each loop, but comparing with the length that was already save in the local variable. For an array that has a length 10 it can save +- 1800 gas.

Title : its cheaper to use block.timestamp directly   Impact :  Its cheaper to use block.timestamp directly instead calling it through a _blocktimestamp() function.  POC :  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/Oracle.sol#L65
