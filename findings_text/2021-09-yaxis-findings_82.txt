# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact A theoretical issue is that the decimals of USDC may change as they use an upgradeable contract so you cannot assume that it stays 6 decimals forever:   balances[1] = stableSwap3Pool.balances(1).mul(10**12); // USDC  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps A simple solution would be to call .decimals() on token contract to query it on the go. Then you will not need to hardcode it but gas usage will increase.
