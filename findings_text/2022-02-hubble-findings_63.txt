# QA Report  # Low Findings  ## L01: Add modifiers to ensure that dependencies are synced  ### Description  The `syncDeps` function exists in the AMM, InsuranceFund and MarginAccount contracts as a helper function to sync the shared contract addresses between the Registry contract. It does not however ensure that all contracts are actually in synced i.e. if the Registry contract changes, there are no checks to ensure that the addresses are still in sync.  ## L02: Adhere to the Check Effect Interactions pattern best practice  ### Line References  [https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/VUSD.sol#L62-L64](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/VUSD.sol#L62-L64)  ### Description  Update internal state before transferring tokens out.  # Non-Critical Findings  ## NC01: Avoid rebase tokens  ### Line References  [https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L548](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L548)  ### Description  Be mindful when adding collateral as some token implementations e.g. rebase tokens are not handled by the smart contract.  ## NC02: Incorrect comment for `_getLiquidationInfo`  ### Line References  [https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L458](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble/blob/main/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L458)  ### Description  `_getLiquidationInfo` doesnâ€™t actually revert. It is the parent liquidation function that reverts if it receives a `LiquidationStatus` that is not `IS_LIQUIDATABLE`.  ## NC03: Add a rescue token / ETH function  ### Description  In the event ETH / tokens are mistakenly sent to the contracts, it is possible to withdraw them through a `rescueToken` or `rescueETH` function. This function can only be called by governance.
