# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact boolean flag 'matured' could be removed if you agree to accept maturityRate > 0 as a matured vault, basically replacing:   require(!matured, 'already matured'); with:   require(maturityRate == 0, 'already matured'); This would eliminate one storage variable and thus reduce gas usage. The risk is that exchangeRateCurrent can never be 0 as this would mean an immature state.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider getting rid of 'matured' as per suggestion.
