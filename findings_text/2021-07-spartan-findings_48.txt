# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  - `calcClaimBondedLP()` returns `_BONDVAULT.calcBondedLP(()` which is a view function. Hence, `calcClaimBondedLP()` can be a view function as well. - `hasMinority()` is not called within the contract. Hence, the `public` keyword can be reduced to `external` to save gas.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  - Restrict `calcClaimBondedLP()` visibility to `view` (ie. add `view` keyword). - Reduce `hasMinority()` from `public` to `external`
