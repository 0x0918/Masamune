# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details   ## Impact  Users that mint Synths do not get pool shares, so exiting of normal LP can lead to their losses as no funds can be left for retrieval.  ## Proof of Concept  3 types of mint/burn: NFT, Fungible and Synths. Synths are most vilnerable as they do not have share: LP own the pool, so Synth's funds are lost in scenarios similar to: 1. LP deposit both sides to a pool 2. Synth deposit and mint a Synth 3. LP withdraws all as she owns all the pool liquidity, even when provided only part of it 4. Synth can't withdraw as no assets left  burn NFT LP: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/main/contracts/dex-v2/pool/BasePoolV2.sol#L270  burn fungible LP: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-vader/blob/main/contracts/dex-v2/pool/VaderPoolV2.sol#L374  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Take into account liquidity that was provided by Synth minting.
