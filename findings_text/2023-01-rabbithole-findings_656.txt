As shown by the claim flowchart, the quest should be initially started before the user completes the on-chain tasks and mints a receipt. At the current moment within `mintReceipt` there is no modifier or check through the code that would revert if quest has not started at both the function level and at the start time.  ## Impact If there is sufficient validation by the rabbithole ECSDA hash endpoint to check off-chain by calling various view functions from the Quest Contract to establish whether the Quest has truly started then it will not be an issue. However, it may be good practice to implement this check within the contract. Hence why I have labelled as potentially a medium risk.  ## Proof of Concept Provide direct links to all referenced code in GitHub. Add screenshots, logs, or any other relevant proof that illustrates the concept.
