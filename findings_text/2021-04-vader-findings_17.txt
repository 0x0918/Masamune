# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact There is some unused / redundant code present.  Router.sol defines repayDelay but it is never used Vault.sol initializes POOLS twice, with the same value.  ## Proof of Concept Router.sol: uint public repayDelay = 3600;  Vault.sol:  function init(address _vader, address _usdv, address _router, ... ..         POOLS = _pool; ..           POOLS = _pool;     ## Tools Used Editor  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Remove redundant code
