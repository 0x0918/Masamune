# Handle  pants   # Vulnerability details  The function `Basket.auctionBurn()` uses the `onlyAuction` and `nonReentrant` modifier, with this order.  ## Impact The `nonReentrant` modifier doesn't protect agains reentrancy during the execution of the first modifier. Practically, there cannot be any reentrancy there when considering the current implementation of `onlyAuction`, but it is still a best practice recommendation for safe programming.  ## Tool Used Manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Use the `nonReentrant` modifier before any other modifier.
