# Handle  0x0x0x   # Vulnerability details  ## Concept  In `MovingAverage.sol`, `uint64` is used for computation of time etc. But computations with `uint64` does cost more gas and furthermore `block.timestamp` is `uint256`, which is additionally casted to `uint64`. `uint32` is used for indexes, but this can also be changed with `uint256`.  Same applies for `RewardDistributer.sol.`  ## Recommendation  Use `uint256` rather than custom `uint`.
