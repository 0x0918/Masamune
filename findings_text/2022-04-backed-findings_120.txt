Thanks for a very well documented and tested codebase.  Just one note to pass on here: there's a typo in the terms `maxPerAnumInterest` and `perAnumInterestRate`, which are used in a few places in the codebase. This should be "per annum" to mean "per year." (Or just consider "per year" or "annual" in English instead). The phrase "per anum" is a medical term that means something entirely different :)
