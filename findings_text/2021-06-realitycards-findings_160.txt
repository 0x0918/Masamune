# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability Details  The `RCNftHubL2.safeTransferFrom` function does not correctly implement the ERC721 spec:  > When using safeTransferFrom, the token contract checks to see that the receiver is an IERC721Receiver, which implies that it knows how to handle ERC721 tokens. [ERC721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-safeTransferFrom)  This check is not implemented, it just drops the `_data` argument.  ## Impact  Contracts that don't know how to handle ERC721 tokens (are not an `IERC721Receiver`) can accept them but they should not when using `safeTransferFrom` according to spec.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Implement the `IERC721Receiver` check in `safeTransferFrom`.
