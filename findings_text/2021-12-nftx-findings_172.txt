# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Consider introducing a reasonable global upper limit for timelockLength in XTokenUpgradeable and TimelockRewardDistributionTokenImpl, so the users can't be locked out of their tokens forever.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps XTokenUpgradeable and TimelockRewardDistributionTokenImpl should not trust the external input but have explicitly declared boundaries for values like timelock length to reduce possibilities of unexpected outcomes.
