# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  In `Router.sol`, the second `else if` statement in the function `swapWithSynthsWithLimit` is unnecessary.  ## Proof of Concept  Referenced code: [Router.sol#L162](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-04-vader/blob/main/vader-protocol/contracts/Router.sol#L162)  ## Tools Used  None  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider using `else {...}`, which has the identical behavior to save gas.
