# Handle  pants   # Vulnerability details  The function `Token.approve()` emits `Approval` events when the allowance hasn't changed and left as it was before that transaction.  ## Impact There is no reason to emit these `Approval` events because nothing has changed in the system. Such events are only going to confuse users.  ## Tool Used Manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Emit these events only when the new allowance is different than the old one.
