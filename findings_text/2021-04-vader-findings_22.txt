# Handle  gpersoon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function transferOut of Pools.sol contains a iERC20(_token).transfer where the result of the function isn't checked. This could result in transfers that don't succeed are undetected.  ## Proof of Concept Pools.sol:   function transferOut(address _token, uint _amount, address _recipient) internal {         if(_token == VADER){             pooledVADER = pooledVADER - _amount; // Accounting         } else if(_token == USDV) {             pooledUSDV = pooledUSDV - _amount;  // Accounting         }         if(_recipient != address(this)){             iERC20(_token).transfer(_recipient, _amount);         }     }  ## Tools Used Editor  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add a require statement to check the result: require(...transfer(...) )
