# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `CrowdSale.initCrowdsale` function checks that the auction token has 18 decimals through `IERC20(_token).decimals() == 18`. This seems to be related to `AUCTION_TOKEN_DECIMALS` and these values should not get ouf of sync.  ## Impact These values can easily get out of sync.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Create another named constant and set it to `18` decimals:  ```solidity uint256 private constant AUCTION_TOKEN_DECIMAL_PLACES = 18; uint256 private constant AUCTION_TOKEN_DECIMALS = 10 ** AUCTION_TOKEN_DECIMAL_PLACES; ```
