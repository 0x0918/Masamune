Low risk, non-critical   Quality coding :  1. Line number 191, 192 can be above Line number 202,       https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-yield/blob/6ab092b8c10e4dabb470918ae15c6451c861655f/contracts/Witch.sol#L191-L192           https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-yield/blob/6ab092b8c10e4dabb470918ae15c6451c861655f/contracts/Witch.sol#L202      Because, balances  and debt  are used after this line 202 only. This could save the execution cost. Its type of gas savings too. I believe this is better       way of coding.  2.  Comment could be corrected as under-collateralized in,      https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-yield/blob/6ab092b8c10e4dabb470918ae15c6451c861655f/contracts/Witch.sol#L14  3. initialization : its better to initialize as zero in below line of code. Relying on the unknown storage data could be risky.     https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-yield/blob/6ab092b8c10e4dabb470918ae15c6451c861655f/contracts/Witch.sol#L133  4. variable name suggestion in below line of code.     https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-yield/blob/6ab092b8c10e4dabb470918ae15c6451c861655f/contracts/Witch.sol#L99-L100     proportion = VaultProportion,     initialOffer = ColletralProportion   5. code simplification:     https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-yield/blob/6ab092b8c10e4dabb470918ae15c6451c861655f/contracts/Witch.sol#L303-L309     Since artIn already knw from the line - 303, I would write the condition as below instead of using the ternary operator. Because the code could      simple and readable.    if( artIn > auction_.art )         artIn = auction_.art;  6. I would suggest the contract name as LiquidEngine.sol instead of Witch.sol    Similarly, the variable , otherWitches could be OtherLiquidEngine    Function name, setAnotherWitch could be seAnotherLiquidEngine  7. Its better to use the same datatype in all places. I see there are too many castings. it could tough to track each of the casting to verify appropriate      data type during coding. There could be possibility of missing in some places.  8. For more decentralization: It could better if the governor related cautions is displayed in front end. For example, displaying the auctioner reward in front end.
