# Handle  0x0x0x   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Gas optimization  ## Finding ```  contracts/token/FSD.sol:174: require(bonded > 0, "FSD::mintHatch: Insufficient Deposit"); ``` On L170, we check whether `bonded` is bigger than 5 ETH. After multiplying with `HATCH_CURVE_RATIO`, it is still over 0. Therefore, it is a tautology and not needed.  ## Proof of Concept Provide direct links to all referenced code in GitHub. Add screenshots, logs, or any other relevant proof that illustrates the concept.  ## Tools Used  Manual analysis
