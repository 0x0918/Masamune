# Handle  goatbug   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Use less storage slots  ## Proof of Concept     struct Proposal {         uint256 licenseFee;         string tokenName;         string tokenSymbol;         address proposer;         address[] tokens;         uint256[] weights;         address basket;     } License fee is a smaller number does not need to be uint256.   Could use an 8 bit value and pack it comfortable with one of the addresses to save a full storage slot.   ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps
