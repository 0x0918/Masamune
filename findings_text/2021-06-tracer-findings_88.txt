# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details   When `LibMath.abs` is called with -2^255 (`type(int256).min`), it tries to multiply it by `-1` but it'll fail as it exceeds the max signed 256-bit integers.  ## Impact The function will fail with an implicit error that might be hard to locate.  ## Recommendation Throw an error similar to `toInt256` like `int256 overflow`.
