# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact AccessControl capabilities aren't used.  ## Proof of Concept In `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol`, `AccessControl` seem superfluous: ``` 7: import "@yield-protocol/utils-v2/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol"; ... 15: contract ConvexStakingWrapper is ERC20, AccessControl { ``` In the original `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol`, this `AccessControl` isn't inherited.   In this contract, I believe role-based capabilities were thought of, but were forgotten or abandonned.  ## Tools Used VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Either use the capabilities from `AccessControl`, or delete the import + the inheritance to save gas.
