# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  ## Vulnerability Details  The `uberOwner` cannot do the same things the owner can. They can "only" set the reference contract for the market.  The same ideas apply to `Treasury` and `Factory`'s `uberOwner`.  ## Impact  The name is misleading as it sounds like the uber-owner is more powerful than the owner.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Uberowner should at least be able to set the owner if not be allowed to call all functions that an `owner` can. Alternatively, rename the `uberOwner`.
