# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  The `notHalted` modifier in `depositMultiple()` is redundant because it is checked (multiple times) by the underlying function call to `deposit()`.  Further optimizations may be done to implement an internal `_deposit()` function that will be called by both `deposit()` and `depositMultiple()` so that `notHalted` is only checked once.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  Remove the `notHalted` modifier in `depositMultiple()`.
