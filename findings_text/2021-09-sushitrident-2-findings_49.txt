# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager.addIncentive` performs an unnecessary check:  ```solidity require(current <= incentive.endTime, "ALREADY_ENDED"); ```  As it already checks that `current <= incentive.startTime` and `incentive.startTime < incentive.endTime`, this check is unnecessary and will always be true by transitivity.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Remove the check to save on gas.
