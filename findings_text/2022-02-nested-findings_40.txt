# Codebase Impressions & Summary  As this is a mitigation contest, there were far less issues discovered. Overall, the contracts were well-documented and are of high quality. The high and medium severity issues raised previously are rectified in the new codebase while the low and non critical issues are either fixed or acknowledged.  # Non-Critical Findings  ## NC01: Inconsistent capitalization for event `reserveUpdated`  ### Line References  [https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-nested/blob/main/contracts/NestedRecords.sol#L22](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-nested/blob/main/contracts/NestedRecords.sol#L22)  ### Description  All declared events are in PascalCase except `reserveUpdated`.  ## NC02: Spelling Error  ### Line References  [https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-nested/blob/main/contracts/FeeSplitter.sol#L32-L33](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-nested/blob/main/contracts/FeeSplitter.sol#L32-L33)  [https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-nested/blob/main/contracts/FeeSplitter.sol#L37](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-nested/blob/main/contracts/FeeSplitter.sol#L37)  `weigth` â†’ `weight`
