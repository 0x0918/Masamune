# Handle  gzeon   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The revert reason in L74 is inaccurate. It should be "ragequit more than assigned". L72-75 ```         require(             (claimed[thisSender] + multiplier) <= key,             "already ragequit all you tokens"         ); ``` The original revert string wrongly implies that claimed[thisSender] >= key Might cause confusing when user who have not yet claimed mistakenly supplied a multiplier > key
