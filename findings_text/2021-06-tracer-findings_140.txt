# Handle  shw   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The `averagePriceForPeriod` function of `LibPrices` does not handle the case where `j` equals 0 (i.e., no trades happened in the last 24 hours). The transaction reverts due to dividing by 0 without a proper error message returned.  ## Proof of Concept  Referenced code: [LibPrices.sol#L73](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-tracer/blob/main/src/contracts/lib/LibPrices.sol#L73)  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add `require(j > 0, "...")` before line 73 to handle this special case.
