# Low and Non-critical ## tickets can get locked if a user calls `transferDelegationTo` with the address of the `TWABDelegator` contract as the `to` parameter, the tokens will be transferred to the address without minting the user the stake token, so maybe you can think of adding this functionality. I know that there is the `withdrawDelegationToStake` function for that, but that can be nice to enable it that way too.
