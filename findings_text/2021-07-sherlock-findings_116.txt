# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `SherXERC20.initializeSherXERC20` function has `initialize` in its name which indicates that it should only be called once to initialize the storage. But it can be repeatedly called to overwrite and update the ERC20 name and symbol.  ## Recommendation Consider an `initializer` modifier or reverting if `name` or `symbol` is already set.
