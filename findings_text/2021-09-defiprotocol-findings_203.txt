# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Hardcoding numbers that depend on other variables is error-prone, e.g.     require(newOwnerSplit <= 2e17); // 20% You must not forget to update this if you decide to change the BASE value.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Better define a separate constant that directly depends on the BASE, e.g.:     uint256 private constant MAX_OWNER_SPLIT = BASE / 5; // 20%     require(newOwnerSplit <= MAX_OWNER_SPLIT);
