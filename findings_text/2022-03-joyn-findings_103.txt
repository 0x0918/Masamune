# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-joyn/blob/main/splits/contracts/Splitter.sol#L156-L159   # Vulnerability details  ## Proof of Concept  ```solidity         require(             IRoyaltyVault(msg.sender).getSplitter() == address(this),             "Unauthorised to increment window"         ); ```  The authorization check in `incrementWindow` can be easily passed. However, `incrementWindow` can change the value of `currentWindow` which is used for loop. It should be guard properly.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-joyn/blob/main/splits/contracts/Splitter.sol#L50   ```solidity for (uint256 i = 0; i < currentWindow; i++) { ```   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider using white list for this task.
