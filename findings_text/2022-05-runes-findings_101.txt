1. In ForgottenRunesWarriorsGuild.mint the function isn't following the checks-effects-interactions pattern. Even though there is nonReentrant modifier it is still better to follow the pattern since in very rare cases there can still be possible reentrancy.  Recommended steps:  Move numMinted += 1; Before the _safeMint()  See here: https://inspexco.medium.com/cross-contract-reentrancy-attack-402d27a02a15  2. In both contracts you are using a floating pragma.   Recommended Steps:  Remove the ^ from both contracts. This will lock the compiler version.  See here: https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-103
