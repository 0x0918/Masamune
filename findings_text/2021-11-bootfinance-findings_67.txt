# Handle  pants   # Vulnerability details  The function `MainToken.__init__()` (the constructor) emits `Transfer` events when the amount minted for `msg.sender` is zero. This is always the case, as the value of the constant `INITIAL_SUPPLY` is zero.  ## Impact There is no reason to emit these `Transfer` events because nothing has changed in the system. Such events are only going to confuse users.  ## Tool Used Manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Emit these events only when the amount minted for `msg.sender` is not zero.
