# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `Withdraw` event in `LegacyController.withdraw` emits the `_amount` variable which is the _initial, desired_ amount to withdraw. It should emit the actual withdrawn amount instead, which is transferred in the last `token.balanceOf(address(this))` call.  ## Impact The actual withdrawn amount, which can be lower than `_amount`, is part of the event. This is usually not what you want (and it can already be decoded from the function argument).  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Use it or remove it.
