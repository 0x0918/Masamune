# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `setWeights` function only stores the `uint16` part of `_weights[i]` in storage (`ps.sherXWeight = uint16(_weights[i])`). However, to calculate `weightAdd/weightSub` the full value (not truncated to 16 bits) is used. This can lead to discrepancies as the actually added part is different from the one tracked in the `weightAdd` variable.
