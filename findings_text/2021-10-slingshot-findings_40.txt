# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Native fund transfers into the executioner contract are only expected from the wrapped token contract. Hence, it would be good to restrict incoming fund transfers to prevent accidental native fund transfers from other sources.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Modify the `receive()` function to only accept transfers from the wrapped token contract.  ```jsx receive() external payable {   require(msg.sender == address(wrappedNativeToken), 'only wrapped native token'); } ```
