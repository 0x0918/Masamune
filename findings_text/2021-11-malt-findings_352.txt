# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact When auction.endingTime == now, function purchaseArbitrageTokens thinks that auction is still active, while isAuctionFinished and earlyExitReturn think that it has ended: purchaseArbitrageTokens: ```solidity   require(auction.endingTime >= now, "Auction is already over"); ``` isAuctionFinished: ```solidity   return auction.endingTime > 0 && (now >= auction.endingTime || ...); ``` earlyExitReturn: ```solidity   if(active || block.timestamp < auctionEndTime) {     return 0;   } ```  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider unifying it across the functions.
