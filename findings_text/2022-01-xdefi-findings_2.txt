# Handle  TomFrenchBlockchain   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Reduced readability  ## Proof of Concept  In a number of placed we seem to be inlining an assignment with the usage of that variable:  https://github.com/XDeFi-tech/xdefi-distribution/blob/3856a42df295183b40c6eee89307308f196612fe/contracts/XDEFIDistribution.sol#L40  https://github.com/XDeFi-tech/xdefi-distribution/blob/3856a42df295183b40c6eee89307308f196612fe/contracts/XDEFIDistribution.sol#L70  https://github.com/XDeFi-tech/xdefi-distribution/blob/3856a42df295183b40c6eee89307308f196612fe/contracts/XDEFIDistribution.sol#L83  This is quite atypical in my experience and reduces readability: lines which contain require statements and event emission now modify contract storage.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider whether any small benefits to gas/compactness are worth the reduced clarity.
