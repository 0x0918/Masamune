# Handle  a_delamo   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  `RCMarket` contains the constant variable `isMarket` to indicate it is a Market `bool public constant override isMarket = true;`. This is after used in `RCFactory` ``` function changeMarketApproval(address _market) external onlyGovernors {         require(_market != address(0));         // check it's an RC contract         IRCMarket _marketToApprove = IRCMarket(_market);         assert(_marketToApprove.isMarket());         isMarketApproved[_market] = !isMarketApproved[_market];         emit LogMarketApproved(_market, isMarketApproved[_market]);     } ```  Why not use `mappingOfMarkets` to verify the address is a Market? This would reduce the state space used.
