# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `Basket.changePublisher` function is used for both setting a new pending publisher as well as accepting the publisher transfer **from** the pending publisher.  ## Impact Once a pending publisher has been set, no other publisher can be set and if the pending publisher does not accept it, the contract is locked out of setting any other publishers. Setting a wrong publisher can naturally occur.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add an option to set a new pending publisher even if there already is a pending publisher.
