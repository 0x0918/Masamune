# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `ThreePieceWiseLinearPriceCurve.adjustParams` function does not check that `_cutoff1 <= _cutoff2` and also does not revert in this case. However, this always indicates an error in how this function should be used.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add a `_cutoff1 <= _cutoff2` check.
