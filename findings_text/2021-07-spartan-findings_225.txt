# Handle  0xsanson   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact In Router.sol, the function addLiquidityForMember() doesn't check inputBase and inputToken. Since we know they can't both be zero (it wouldn't change anything and user pays the gas for nothing).  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/main/contracts/Router.sol#L51  ## Tools Used editor  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider adding a require `inputBase>0 || inputToken>0`.
