# Save gas in for loops by unchecked arithmetic  The for loop of `_acceptNewTerms` in MapleLoanInternals.sol: https://github.com/maple-labs/loan/blob/main/contracts/MapleLoanInternals.sol#L258-L261  There is no overflow risk of `i`.  ## Recommendation  Use `unchecked` block to avoid overflow checks:  ```         for (uint256 i; i < calls_.length; ) {             ( bool success, ) = refinancer_.delegatecall(calls_[i]);             require(success, "MLI:ANT:FAILED");             unchecked {                 ++i;             }         } ```
