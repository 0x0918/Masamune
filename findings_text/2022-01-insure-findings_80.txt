# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Increased gas cost  ## Proof of Concept The variable `T_0` can go through 2 assignments in a row: Here: ``` 75:         uint256 T_0 = _totalLiquidity; 76:         if (T_0 > T_1) { 77:             T_0 = T_1; 78:         } ``` And here: ``` 134:         uint256 T_0 = _totalLiquidity; 135:         if (T_0 > T_1) { 136:             T_0 = T_1; 137:         } ```  The code can be optimized as such to save some gas: ```         uint256 T_0 = _totalLiquidity > T_1 ? _totalLiquidity : T_1; ```  ## Tools Used VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Apply the refacto
