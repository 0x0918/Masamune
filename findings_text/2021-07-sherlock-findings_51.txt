# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  This is probably an oversight since `SafeERC20` was imported and `safeTransfer()` was used for ERC20 token transfers. Nevertheless, note that `approve()` will fail for certain token implementations that do not return a boolean value (Eg. OMG and ADX tokens). Hence it is recommend to use `safeApprove()`.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  Update to `_token.safeApprove(address(_native), totalToken)` in `tokenUnload()`.
