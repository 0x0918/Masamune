# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Gas is overspent on calculations and checks  ## Proof of Concept  (initialStake - claimedInitialStake) figure is calculated after require check, so the subtraction itself can be unchecked. Also, it is done twice now, can save the result to memory and use it.  https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge/blob/main/contracts/L2/pool/DelegatorPool.sol#L73  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider calculating (initialStake - claimedInitialStake) one time and in unchecked scope.
