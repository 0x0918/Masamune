# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact When a contract imports and implements an interface or another contracts, it doesn't need to import the libraries that were already imported there.  Removing these imports will save gas.  ## Proof of Concept `InsureDAOERC20` imports the following:  ``` 5: import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol"; 6: import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Metadata.sol"; ```  The following contracts inherit `InsureDAOERC20` and also make those imports: `CDSTemplate`, `IndexTemplate`, `PoolTemplate`  ## Tools Used VS Code  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Remove the unused imports to reduce the size of the contract and save some deployment gas.
