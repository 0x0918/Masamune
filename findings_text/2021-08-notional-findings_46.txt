# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact function notionalCallback (in NotionalV1ToNotionalV2 and CompoundToNotionalV2) declares to return uint, however, no actual value is returned.   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Either remove the return declaration or return the intended value (I assume it may return a value that it gets from depositUnderlyingToken/depositAssetToken). Otherwise, it may confuse other protocols that later may want to integrate with you.
