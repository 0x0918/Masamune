# 1. Low - transfer return value is ignored  ## Impact  Some ERC20 tokens, such as USDT, don't revert when transfer/transferFrom fails. The transfer return value has to be checked (as there are some other tokens that returns false instead revert). safeTransfer should be used instead of transfer  ## Proof of Concept  safeTransferFrom should be used instead of transferFrom on this line https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-joyn/blob/main/core-contracts/contracts/CoreCollection.sol#L175  ## Tools Used  Manual analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Use safeTransfer instead of transfer or check the return value of transfer. The return value of transfer is checked properly in these locations https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-joyn/blob/main/royalty-vault/contracts/RoyaltyVault.sol#L44 https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-joyn/blob/main/royalty-vault/contracts/RoyaltyVault.sol#L52 https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-joyn/blob/main/splits/contracts/Splitter.sol#L237  # 2. Low - onlyUnInitialized modifier missing from initialize function  ## Impact  The CoreCollection initialize function is missing the onlyUnInitialized function. The onlyUnInitialized modifier is not used in the contract right now and this allows the initialize function to be called more than once.  ## Proof of Concept  The onlyUnInitialized modifier prevents functions from being run if the initialized is set to true https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-joyn/blob/main/core-contracts/contracts/CoreCollection.sol#L46  This modifier is missing from the initialize function https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-joyn/blob/main/core-contracts/contracts/CoreCollection.sol#L87  ## Tools Used  Manual analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add the onlyUnInitialized modifier to the initialize function
