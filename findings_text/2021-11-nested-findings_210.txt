# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Array bounds check violation will happen if the function be called with arrays of different lengths.  ## Proof of Concept  Loop is performed by names array, while both arrays are accessed: ``` for (uint256 i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {   if (operators[names[i]] != destinations[i]) { ``` https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested/blob/main/contracts/OperatorResolver.sol#L27  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Add a check: ``` require(names.length == destinations.length, "OperatorResolver::areAddressesImported: Input lengths must match"); ```
