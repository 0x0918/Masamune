# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact No need to check that _startTime < 10000000000 as it is later checked against _endTime which is also < 10000000000 :         require(_startTime < 10000000000, "Crowdsale: enter an unix timestamp in seconds, not miliseconds");         require(_endTime < 10000000000, "Crowdsale: enter an unix timestamp in seconds, not miliseconds");         ...         require(_endTime > _startTime, "Crowdsale: end time must be older than start price");  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Remove this line:     require(_startTime < 10000000000, "Crowdsale: enter an unix timestamp in seconds, not miliseconds");
