# Missing Zero Chcks  ## impact Zero-address checks for input validation of address-type variables is a best-practice. While this is implemented in some places, there are missing ones.  ## POC  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-rolla/blob/a06418c9cc847395f3699bdf684a9ac066651ed7/quant-protocol/contracts/ QuantCalculator.sol#L55-L57  strikeAssetDecimals and optionsFactory variables do not perform zero checks which could result in lose of funds or malfunctions.  ## Tools Used Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add zero-address checks   # Arbitrary send  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-rolla/blob/a06418c9cc847395f3699bdf684a9ac066651ed7/quant-protocol/contracts/timelock/TimelockController.sol#L414  ## impact Unprotected call to a function sending Ether to an arbitrary address.  ## Tools Used Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Ensure that an arbitrary user cannot withdraw unauthorized funds.
