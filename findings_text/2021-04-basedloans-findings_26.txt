# Handle  paulius.eth   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact contract CompoundLens functions cTokenMetadata and cTokenBalances compare against "bETH" while contract SimplePriceOracle function getUnderlyingPrice compares against "cETH". It is not clear if this SimplePriceOracle will be used in production, probably only for testing, but still would be nice to unify it across all the contracts.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Replace "cETH" with "bETH" in SimplePriceOracle function getUnderlyingPrice.
