# Handle  hyh   # Vulnerability details   ## Impact  On calling with arrays of different lengths various malfunctions are possible as the arrays are used as given. System then will fail with low level array access message  ## Proof of Concept  notifyRewardAmounts:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage/blob/main/openleverage-contracts/contracts/farming/FarmingPools.sol#L163   initDistributions:  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage/blob/main/openleverage-contracts/contracts/farming/FarmingPools.sol#L131  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Require that (stakeTokens, reward) and (stakeTokens, startTimes, durations) arrays' lengths match within each set
