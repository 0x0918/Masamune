# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The following lines in `takeOutRewardTokens()` are only needed in the case where `endEpoch != 0`.  ```jsx uint128 currentEpoch = uint128(block.number); uint128 epochs = amount / allocatedTokensPerEpoch; ```  Hence, they can be shifted inside the "if" block.  Furthermore, a double calculation of `endEpoch - epochs` can be avoided by saving the result into a new variable `newEpoch`.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  ```jsx if (endEpoch != 0) {   uint128 newEpoch = endEpoch - (amount / allocatedTokensPerEpoch);   require(newEpoch  > uint128(block.number), "Cannot takeout rewards from past");   endEpoch = newEpoch; } ```
