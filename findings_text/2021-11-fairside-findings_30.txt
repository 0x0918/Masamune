# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  `DURATION.sub(CLIFF)` is calculated in `calculateVestingClaim()`. Since both are constants, it would be better to define a new constant `LINEAR_VEST_AFTER_CLIFF` that refers to the vest duration after the cliff.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  `uint256 private constant LINEAR_VEST_AFTER_CLIFF = 18 * ONE_MONTH;`
