# Handle  tensors   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact There are no minimum amounts out, or checks that frontrunning/slippage is sufficiently mitigated. This means that anyone with enough capital can force arbitrarily large slippage by sandwiching transactions, close to 100%.   ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Pool.sol#L284  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-07-spartan/blob/e2555aab44d9760fdd640df9095b7235b70f035e/contracts/Pool.sol#L296  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add a minimum amount out parameter. The function reverts if the minimum amount isn't obtained.
