# Handle  @cmichelio   # Vulnerability details   ## Vulnerability Details  The `harvest` calls `calcCurrentReward` which computes `_secondsSinceClaim = block.timestamp - mapMemberSynth_lastTime[member][synth];`. As one can claim different synths than the synths that they deposited, `mapMemberSynth_lastTime[member][synth]` might still be uninitialized and the `_secondsSinceClaim` becomes the current block timestamp.  ## Impact  The larger the `_secondsSinceClaim` the larger the rewards. This bug allows claiming a huge chunk of the rewards.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Let users only harvest synths that they deposited.
