# Handle  0xRajeev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The deploySynth() function in Pools.sol is expected to perform a check on the token parameter to determine that it is neither VADER or USDV before calling Factory’s deploySynth() function.   However, the require() incorrectly uses ‘||’ operator instead of ‘&&’ which allows both VADER and USDV to be supplied as the token parameters. This will allow an attacker to deploy either VADER or USDV as a Synth which will break assumptions throughout the entire protocol. Protocol will break and funds may be lost.  ## Proof of Concept  https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-04-vader/blob/3041f20c920821b89d01f652867d5207d18c8703/vader-protocol/contracts/Pools.sol#L138   ## Tools Used  Manual Analysis  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Change ‘||’ operator to ‘&&’ in the require statement: require(token != VADER && token != USDV);
