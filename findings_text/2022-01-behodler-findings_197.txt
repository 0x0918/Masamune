# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact   Due to how `constant` variables are implemented (replacements at compile-time), an expression assigned to a `constant` variable is recomputed each time that the variable is used, which wastes some gas.      See: [ethereum/solidity#9232](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9232)  > Consequences: each usage of a "constant" costs ~100gas more on each access (it is still a little better than storing the result in storage, but not much..). since these are not real constants, they can't be referenced from a real constant environment (e.g. from assembly, or from another library )    ## Proof of Concept   ``` UniswapHelper.sol:56:  uint256 constant year = (1 days * 365); ```     ## Tools Used   VS Code      ## Recommended Mitigation Steps   Replace with: ``` UniswapHelper.sol:56:  uint256 constant year = 365 days; ```
