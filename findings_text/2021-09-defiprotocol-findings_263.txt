# Handle  0xsanson   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function `Factory.proposeBasketLicense` at the end emits `BasketLicenseProposed(msg.sender, tokenName)` and returns the id of the proposal. This `id` should also be written to the log, since it's needed by the proposer (for createBasket), and they may not see the return value of an external function.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-defiProtocol/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Factory.sol#L87-L90  ## Tools Used editor  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider redefining the event to contain the id of the proposal.
