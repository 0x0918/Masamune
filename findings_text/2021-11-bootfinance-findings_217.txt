# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `Swap.constructor` checks if both arrays `_pooledTokens` and `decimals` are of length two, but then does another check if these arrays have the same length.  ```solidity require(     _pooledTokens.length == decimals.length,     "_pooledTokens decimals mismatch" ); ```  This check will always be true as it has been checked that both arrays are of length two.
