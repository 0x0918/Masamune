# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact In function settleAuction user needs to decide what bounties he/she wants to claim:     function settleAuction(         uint256[] memory bountyIDs     ...     withdrawBounty(bountyIDs); but bounties are stored in a private variable:    Bounty[] private _bounties; and there are no getter (view) functions to view bounties so I think that makes it very inconvenient for the end-user to find the appropriate ids that are relevant, especially considering there could be SPAM bounties as anyone can call addBounty.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Consider exposing public view functions to view bounties.
