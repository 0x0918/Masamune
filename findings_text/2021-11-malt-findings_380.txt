# Handle  Koustre   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact In UniswapHandler, in the function ```removeBuyer``` there is a for loop over an unbounded Buyers array, which if the buyers array gets too large can cause a denial of service and prevents the contract from being able to remove buyer roles from users/contracts. This would allow users/contracts to circumvent recovery mode and to continue to purchase and sell tokens using the contract.  ## Proof of Concept Provide direct links to all referenced code in GitHub. Add screenshots, logs, or any other relevant proof that illustrates the concept.  ## Tools Used - Manual Study ## Recommended Mitigation Steps - remove unbounded for loop
