# Handle  pants   # Vulnerability details  In Treasury.editSchedule      function editSchedule(         uint256 dripStart_,         uint256 dripRate_,         address target_,         uint256 amount_     ) public onlyAdmin {         require(tokenSchedules[target_].target != address(0), "Target schedule doesn't exist");         tokenSchedules[target_].dripStart = dripStart_;         tokenSchedules[target_].dripRate = dripRate_;         tokenSchedules[target_].amount = amount_;     }   We suggest to cache  tokenSchedules[target_] at start and then use the cached value to save repeated access to a *storage* state variable.
