# Handle  Dravee   # Vulnerability details  In `IndexTemplate.sol:withdrawable()`, the following can be optimized to save gas and avoid a loss of precision, from: ```                 uint256 _necessaryAmount = _targetLockedCreditScore * totalAllocPoint /  _targetAllocPoint;                 _necessaryAmount = _necessaryAmount *  MAGIC_SCALE_1E6 / targetLev; ``` to ```                 uint256 _necessaryAmount = _targetLockedCreditScore * totalAllocPoint *  MAGIC_SCALE_1E6 /  (_targetAllocPoint * targetLev); ```
