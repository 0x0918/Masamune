# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact function calculateNextBeaconPeriodStartTime accepts _time as a type of uint256 but later explicitly casts it to uint64. While this function is not used internally, it behaves incorrectly when passed a value that uint64 does not hold (for such values it will return a max value of uint64). I don't see a reason why you can't directly accept uint64 here.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Change parameter type to uint64.
