# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `updateAccount` function should capture the latest distributed yield to the Transmuter (stored in `buffer`) and therefore work with the latest `totalDividendPoints` variable. This variable is updated when running a phase distribution with `runPhasedDistribution`.  Unlike all other function that call `updateAccount`, the `unstake` function does not first run a `runPhasedDistribution` modifer to distribute the latest yield.  ## Impact Users that unstake lose out on some yield by not having their alTokens transmuted.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Call `runPhasedDistribution` in `unstake` before the `updateAccount` call, as in `stake` or `transmute`.
