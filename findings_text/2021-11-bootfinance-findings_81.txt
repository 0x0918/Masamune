# Handle  pants   # Vulnerability details  The function `GaugeController.commit_transfer_ownership()` emits `CommitOwnership` events when the future admin hasn't changed and left as it was before that transaction.  ## Impact There is no reason to emit these `CommitOwnership` events because nothing has changed in the system. Such events are only going to confuse users.  ## Tool Used Manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Emit these events only when the new future admin is different than the old one.
