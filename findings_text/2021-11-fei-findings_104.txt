# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  Looking at the TRIBE token implementation, it would be cheaper to call the `transfer()` method as opposed to the the `transferFrom()` method since the latter contains additional logic (Eg. additional SLOAD to fetch the allowance).  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  ```jsx function giveTo(address target, uint256 amount) internal {   bool check = token1.transfer(target, amount);  require(check, "erc20 transfer failed"); } ```
