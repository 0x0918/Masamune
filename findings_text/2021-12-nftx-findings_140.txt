# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `NFTXStakingZap.addLiquidity721ETHTo` function performs a low-level `.call` in `payable(to).call{value: msg.value-amountEth}` but does not check the return value if the call succeeded.  ## Impact If the call fails, the refunds did not succeed and the caller will lose all refunds of `msg.value - amountEth`.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Revert the entire transaction if the refund call fails by checking that the `success` return value of the `payable(to).call(...)` returns `true`.
