# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact Anyone can call function notionalCallback with arbitrary params and pass the auth check. The only auth check can be easily bypassed by setting sender param to the address of this contract. It allows to choose any parameter that I want:     function notionalCallback(         address sender,         address account,         bytes calldata callbackData     ) external returns (uint256) {         require(sender == address(this), "Unauthorized callback");  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps It needs to check that msg.sender is Notional.
