# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `PrizePool.captureAwardBalance` function always sets `_currentAwardBalance = currentAwardBalance` where `currentAwardBalance = currentAwardBalance + unaccountedPrizeBalance = currentAwardBalance + totalInterest - currentAwardBalance = totalInterest`.  Save a checked math addition by just setting `_currentAwardBalance = totalInterest` immediately.
