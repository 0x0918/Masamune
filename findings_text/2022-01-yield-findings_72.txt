# Handle  rfa   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact spend at least 6930 more gas on deployment, and spend 40 gas more per call (by using current implementasion)  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield/blob/main/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L184 https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield/blob/main/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L239  the `TransferHelper` lib just used twice in this contract. remove:(line 16) https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-yield/blob/main/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L16  and just call `TransferHelper.safeTransfer()` directly at those line.  This method is using almost exact the same gas as if we just copying the `safeTransfer()` and remove the `TransferHelper` lib from the contract. (since we need just 1 function from the lib)
