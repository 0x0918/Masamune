## https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/main/protocol/contracts/utils/Preparable.sol#L143 Function _setConfig: No need to set deadlines[key] = 0; as this was already done in _executeDeadline function  ## https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/main/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/Minter.sol#L218 Function _mint: Check that amount is not equal to zero  ``` amount!=0 ```  Note: do same for mintNonInflationTokens  ## https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/main/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/LpGauge.sol#L59 Function claimRewards: Since amount is uint type so amount cannot be <0. Change it to    ``` if (amount == 0) return 0;  ```  Note: Same need to be fixed for other Gauge like AMMGauge  ## https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/main/protocol/contracts/BkdLocker.sol#L214 Function claimFees: If claimable is zero, no need to go further  ``` require(claimable!=0); ```
