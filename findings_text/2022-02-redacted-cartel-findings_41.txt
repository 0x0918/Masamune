## Low severity issues You use IBTRFLY instead of IERC20 to refer to WETH. This is minor because they are both ERC20 tokens but could cause confusion.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/92c4d5810df7b9de15eae55dc7641c8b36cd799d/contracts/ThecosomataETH.sol#L72  You use transfer here, but you could use call instead. Transfer is generally avoided. https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/92c4d5810df7b9de15eae55dc7641c8b36cd799d/contracts/RewardDistributor.sol#L181  ## Non-critical issues You don't need this event here, frontend will be able to get the information based on each individual SetProposal event  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/92c4d5810df7b9de15eae55dc7641c8b36cd799d/contracts/TokemakBribe.sol#L49  You don't have an index on any of the TransferBribe or DepositBribe events, consider adding indexes on token and briber so consumers of events can easily go through them.  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/92c4d5810df7b9de15eae55dc7641c8b36cd799d/contracts/BribeVault.sol#L42-L56
