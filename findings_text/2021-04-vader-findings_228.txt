# Handle  @cmichelio   # Vulnerability details   ## Vulnerability Details  Proposals that passed the threshold ("finalized") can be cancelled by a minority again using the `cancelProposal` functions. It only sets `mapPID_votes` to zero but `mapPID_timeStart` and `mapPID_finalising` stay the same and pass the checks in `finaliseProposal` which queues them for execution.  ## Impact  Proposals cannot be cancelled.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Set a cancel flag and check for it in `finaliseProposal` and in execution.
