# Handle  pmerkleplant   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact The function `getDelegatorDetails()` declares three arrays of type `uint`  (alias for `uint256`).  The variables saved in the arrays are of type `uint128`.  See lines [451-453](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-covalent/blob/main/contracts/DelegatedStaking.sol#L451).  The suggestion is to be consistent with the integer sizes.
