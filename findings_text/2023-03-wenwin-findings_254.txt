# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-wenwin/blob/a260ecba74720c631ab06ecdd67167317b976b60/src/staking/StakedTokenLock.sol#L39-L41   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  According to the design and communication to investors, the tokens that are staked will be locked for a certain period before they can be released to the owner account. However, the owner can still withdraw the tokens if the `block.timestamp` exceeds the `depositDeadline`.  We do not suspect that the owner is a malicious account. But if the code does not match the specifications and documents in a contract that holds critical assets, it can raise questions about potential risks from investors and holders of LOT.   ## Proof of Concept  If the `block.timestamp < depositDeadline`, owner can still withdraw the tokens. https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-wenwin/blob/a260ecba74720c631ab06ecdd67167317b976b60/src/staking/StakedTokenLock.sol#L39-L41  ## Tools Used  Manual  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Change that if the block.timestamp before releasing period, cannot withdraw tokens.  ```diff -    if (block.timestamp > depositDeadline && block.timestamp < depositDeadline + lockDuration) {  +    if (block.timestamp < depositDeadline + lockDuration) {            revert LockPeriodOngoing();     } ```
