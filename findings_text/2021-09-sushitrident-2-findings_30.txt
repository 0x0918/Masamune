# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `DyDxMath.getLiquidityForAmounts/getDx/getDy` functions perform unchecked computations on `priceUpper - priceLower` but they do not check that `priceUpper >= priceLower`.  ## Impact The values can underflow and return much lower liquidity or much higher token amounts than expected.  The calling functions (`mint` and `burn`) also do not check this. For `mint`, it fails further down the callstack at `Ticks.insert`, but `burn` does not fail.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Check that the `lower` and `upper` from the provided parameters for `mint` and `burn` are indeed sorted, i.e., `lower < upper`. It should be checked explicitly at the start of the function.
