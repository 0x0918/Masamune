# Lines of code  https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/BribeVault.sol#L164   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact In BribeVault.sol,  the depositBribeERC20() function deposits a bribe which is an ERC20 token from the briber to the contract itself and then updates the Bribe structs amount and token address.  The issue is that there is no whitelist of acceptable ERC20 tokens that are allowed to interact with the protocol.  Without a proper white list malicious attacker controlled tokens are able to be introduced into the protocol which should not be allowed.  ## Proof of Concept https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-redacted-cartel/blob/main/contracts/BribeVault.sol#L164  ## Tools Used Manual code review   ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Add a whitelist mapping of acceptable tokens and require that the token address argument in the depositBribeERC20() function is a whitelisted token allowed to interact with the protocol.
