# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  The following line  ```jsx address public constant oracleAddress =  0xd1866289B4Bd22D453fFF676760961e0898EE9BF; // oracle with caching ```  is only used in the instantiation of the oracle  `IOracle public constant oracle = IOracle(oracleAddress);`  The first instantiation can be combined with the second to save gas.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  `IOracle public constant oracle = IOracle(0xd1866289B4Bd22D453fFF676760961e0898EE9BF);`
