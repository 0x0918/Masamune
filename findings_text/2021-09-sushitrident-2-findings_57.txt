# Handle  WatchPug   # Vulnerability details  Members of structs should be grouped into bunches of 32 bytes for saving gas.  For example:  https://github.com/sushiswap/trident/blob/c405f3402a1ed336244053f8186742d2da5975e9/contracts/pool/concentrated/ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager.sol#L15-L23  `ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager.sol#Incentive` `rewardsUnclaimed` and `secondsClaimed` can be moved to the bottom to optimize for Variable Packing.
