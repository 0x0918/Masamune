# Handle  pants   # Vulnerability details  The `public` functions `Auction.startAuction()`, `Auction.killAuction()`, `Auction.initialize()`, `Auction.bondForRebalance()`, `Auction.settleAuction()` and `Auction.addBounty()` are never called by `Auction`. Therefore, their visibility can be reduced to `external`.  ## Impact `external` functions are cheaper than `public` functions.  ## Proof of Concept https://gus-tavo-guim.medium.com/public-vs-external-functions-in-solidity-b46bcf0ba3ac  ## Tool Used Manual code review.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Define these functions as `public`.
