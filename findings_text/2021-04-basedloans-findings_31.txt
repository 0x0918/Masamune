# Handle  @cmichelio   # Vulnerability details   ## Vulnerability Details  The `transfer` function is used in `Maximillion.sol` to send ETH to an account.  ## Impact  It is performed with a fixed amount of GAS and might fail if GAS costs change in the future or if a smart contract's fallback function handler is complex.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Consider using the lower-level `.call{value: value}` instead and checking its success return value.
