# Handle  @cmichelio   # Vulnerability details   ## Vulnerability Details  When depositing two different synths, their weight is added to the same `mapMember_weight[_member]` storage variable. When withdrawing the full amount of one synth with `_processWithdraw(synth, member, basisPoints=10000` the full weight is decreased.  The second deposited synth is now essentially weightless.  ## Impact  Users that deposited more than one synth can not claim their fair share of rewards after a withdrawal.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  The weight should be indexed by the synth as well.
