# Handle  0xngndev   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact  In `AaveYield.sol` the functions:  - `liquidityToken` - `_withdrawETH` - `_depositETH`  Make a conditional call to `IWETHGateway(wethGateway).getAWETHAddress()`  This function does not exist in the `wethGateway` contract, causing these function to fail with the error `"Fallback not allowed"`.  The function they should be calling is `getWethAddress()` without the "A".  Small yet dangerous typo.  ### Mitigation Steps  Simply modify:   `IWETHGateway(wethGateway).getAWETHAddress()`  to:  `IWETHGateway(wethGateway).getWETHAddress()`  In the functions mentioned above.
