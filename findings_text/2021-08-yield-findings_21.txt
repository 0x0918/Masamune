# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  Given a configuration of target, contacts and permissions, calling `terminate()` will permanently prevent this configuration from being used again because the state becomes `State.TERMINATED`. All other functions require the configuration to be in the other states (UNKNOWN, PLANNED, or EXECUTED).  In other words, the removal of the restoring option for the configuration through `EmergencyBrake` is permanent.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  Since `EmergencyBrake` cannot reinstate permissions after termination, it would be better to have terminate change its state to UNKNOWN. The TERMINATED state can therefore be removed.
