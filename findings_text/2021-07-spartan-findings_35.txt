# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  The current `changeArrayFeeSize` implementation deletes the entire feeArray (which is used to calculate normalAverageFee for dividends), resulting in having to rebuild the feeArray again.  It would be better to keep the feeArray as is if the `_size` is greater than the current feeArrayLength, or trim it otherwise, so that the calculation `normalAverageFee` has past trade fees to use and is therefore more accurate.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  ```jsx function changeArrayFeeSize(uint _size) external onlyDAO {  arrayFeeSize = _size;   // trim feeArray to match _size   if (_size < feeArray.length) {      uint[] memory tempFeeArray = new uint[](_size);      // copy feeArray for gas optimization      uint[] memory _feeArray = feeArray;    for (uint i = 0; i < _size; i++) {         tempFeeArray[i] = _feeArray[i];    }      feeArray = tempFeeArray;  }   // otherwise, keep feeArray unchanged } ```
