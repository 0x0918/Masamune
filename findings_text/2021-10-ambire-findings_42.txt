# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `SignatureValidatorV2.recoverAddrImpl` function currently uses three `if (mode == *)` checks but the modes are all distinct enum values and therefore an `else if` can be used. This is more efficient because if the first branch is already matched, there's no need to check the `mode` against the remaining values anymore.
