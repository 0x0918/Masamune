# `Twav.sol`  ## `timestamp` in `TwavObservation` is declared as `uint32` but cannot be packed with other variables  Usually, it makes sense to try to follow a Tight Variable Packing approach to not waste gas, but in this case, it's useless and will only cost more gas.  The `timestamp` variable inside the struct will anyway take a whole slot because after it's declaration we have `cumulativeValuation` that is a `uint256`.  Declaring `timestamp` as a `uint256` will allow `NibblVault` to waste less gas because there is no more need to perform all the math + cast operations done on the timestamp (example: `uint32 _blockTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp % 2**32);`).  Consider change the type of `timestamp` to a `uint256`
