## Low Risk Vulnerabilities ### 1. No function to remove gauge from whitelist If governance mistakenly whitelisted a faulty/malicious gauge, there is no way to remove it.  A malicious gauge could mint as much $BKD as it's currently available according to the inflation schedule, in detriment of other gauges' allocation.  #### Recommended Mitigation Steps Unless there's a reason not to, consider adding a function to remove gauge from whitelist in `InflationManager.sol`: ``` function blacklistGauge(address gauge)      external      override      onlyRoles(Roles.GOVERNANCE) {     gauges[gauge] = false; } ``` #### Related Links - https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/InflationManager.sol#L80-L82 - https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/InflationManager.sol#L181-L183
