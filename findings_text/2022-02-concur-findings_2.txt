# Handle  Heartless   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact external visibility uses less gas than public visibility. addRewards is never called internally in this project so does not need public visibility. addRewards was public in the original source from convex because they called addRewards() internally in the initialize() function, which ConvexStakingWrapper does not have.  ## Proof of Concept Line 93 in ConvexStakingWrapper.sol  ## Tools Used  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Change addRewards visibility to external.
