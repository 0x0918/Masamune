## _minDelay can be 0, beating timelock motive  Contract: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/main/contracts/governance/TimelockControllerEmergency.sol#L93  Issue: In constructor, deployer can set _minDelay to 0 which means any proposed transaction can instantly be executed without any delay which beats the basic motive of timelock  Recommendation: Add a check to ensure correct value of _minDelay  ``` require(_minDelay!=0, "Incorrect delay"); ```  ## Missing selector check on operator  Contract: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/main/contracts/governance/scripts/OperatorScripts.sol#L28 https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/main/contracts/OperatorResolver.sol#L20  Issue: The addOperator function is not checking that selector of added operator is not bytes4(0) Same fix is required for requireAndGetOperator function at OperatorResolver.sol#L20  Recommendation: Add below check  ``` require(operator.selector != bytes4(0), "AO-SCRIPT: INVALID_SELECTOR"); ```  ## Unused imports  Contract: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/main/contracts/operators/Yearn/YearnCurveVaultOperator.sol#L12  Issue: Contract is importing CurveHelpers but not using it  Recommendation: Do not import CurveHelpers.sol in YearnCurveVaultOperator
