# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact convictionless can be set via function setConvictionless, however, it is not used anywhere across the system, thus making it useless. Based on the comment above this variable, I expect to see it used in functions like _updateConvictionScore.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Either remove this mapping or use it where intended.
