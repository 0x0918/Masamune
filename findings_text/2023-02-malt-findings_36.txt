And `minThreshold` is calculated as follows: ```     uint256 priceTarget = maltDataLab.getActualPriceTarget(); ``` ```         uint256 latestSample = maltDataLab.maltPriceAverage(0);         uint256 minThreshold = latestSample -           (((latestSample - priceTarget) * sampleSlippageBps) / 10000); ``` This code snippet assumes that `latestSample >= priceTarget`. Although `exchangeRate > priceTarget`, `exchangeRate` is the malt average price during `priceAveragePeriod`. But `latestSample` is one of those malt prices. So `latestSample` can be less than `exchangeRate` and `priceTarget`, so `stabilize` will revert in this case.  ## Tools Used Manual Review  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps  Use `minThreshold = latestSample + (((priceTarget - latestSample) * sampleSlippageBps) / 10000)` when `priceTarget > latestSample`.
