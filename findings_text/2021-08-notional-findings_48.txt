# Handle  pauliax   # Vulnerability details  ## Impact contract NotionalV1ToNotionalV2 has an empty receive function which allows it to receive Ether. I suppose this was needed to receive ETH when withdrawing from WETH. As there is no way to send out accidentally sent ETH from this contract, I suggest adding an auth check to this receive function to only accept ETH from WETH contract.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps require(msg.sender == address(WETH), "Not WETH");
