# Handle  hickuphh3   # Vulnerability details  ### Impact  The lines below of the `addLiquiditySingleForMember()` function  ```jsx address _token = token; if(token == address(0)){_token = WBNB;} // Handle BNB -> WBNB ```  are redundant since `_token` is not used subsequently. Note that `_handleTransferIn()` will perform the handling of native BNB transfers.  ### Recommended Mitigation Steps  The mentioned lines above can be removed.
