# Handle  cmichel   # Vulnerability details  The `TridentNFT.permitAll` function allows the operator (`isApprovedForAll[owner][recoveredAddress]`) to change the operator (and lock themself out). The same functionality without permits does not work as `setApprovalForAll` requires the `owner` authority.  ## Impact `permitAll` should have the same auth checks as `setApprovalForAll` and not allow the `operator` to change the operator.  ## Recommended Mitigation Steps Remove the `|| isApprovedForAll[owner][recoveredAddress]` from the `require` statement.
