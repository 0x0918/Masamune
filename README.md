### Retrieving the data

Currently, Masamune works on the following data sources:

1. [Code4rena findings](https://code4rena.com/reports).
2. [Immunefi bugfixes](https://github.com/immunefi-team/Web3-Security-Library).
3. [DeFi Hacks Analysis](https://wooded-meter-1d8.notion.site/0e85e02c5ed34df3855ea9f3ca40f53b).

### What's next?

I aim to add more data sources, such as: reliable audit shops reports, blog posts from security researchers, etc.

Want to help with that? Message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/VladToie).
