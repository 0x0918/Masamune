### Updating the code4rena datasets via `kanto.py`:

1. Retrieves all repositories from the [code4rena GitHub organization](https://github.com/orgs/code-423n4).

2. Select the repositories that end with `-findings`.

3. Retrieve all the issues from the subsequent `-findings` repositories.

### Search based on the title + "target" of the findings.

> Note: for now, Masamune only handles findings from code4rena repositories.

### What's next?

I aim at creating datasets from all the existing audits from all reliable security audit companies and organize them in a similar manner. Let's boost smart contract security. Want to help with that? Message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/VladToie).
